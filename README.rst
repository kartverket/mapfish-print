Build
-----

Execute the following command():

.. code::

  > ./gradlew build

This will build three artifacts:  print-servlet-xxx.war, print-lib.jar, print-standalone.jar

The `build` also builds the documentation in the `docs/build/site` folder.  To deploy the documentation it should simply be copied to the gh-pages
branch and then committed GitHub will automatically build the updated site at: http://mapfish.github.io/mapfish-print/

If you only want to build the docs simply run

.. code::

  > ./gradlew docs:build

or run build in the docs directory

.. note::

   The test (part of the build) requires the 'Liberation Sans' font, witch can be downloaded
   `here <https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/Liberation-Sans>`_.

Deploy
------

The following command will build and upload all artifacts to the maven central repository.

.. code::

  > ./gradlew uploadArchives -DsshPassphrase=...

You can as well generate a docker image using this command:

.. code::

  > ./gradlew createDocker

If you want to force the version to something custom, you can define the DOCKER_VERSION environment
variable.

To use in Eclipse
-----------------

Create Eclipse project metadata:

.. code::

  > ./gradlew eclipse

Import project into Eclipse


Run from commandline
--------------------

The following command will run the mapfish printer.  The arguments must be supplied to the -PprintArgs="..." parameter.

To list all the commandline options then execute (the current direstory is `./core`):

.. code::

  > ./gradlew print -PprintArgs="-help"

.. code::

  > ./gradlew print -PprintArgs="-config ../examples/src/test/resources/examples/simple/config.yaml -spec ../examples/src/test/resources/examples/simple/requestData.json -output ./output.pdf"

If you want to run in debug mode you can do the following:

.. code::
  > ./gradlew print --debug-jvm -PprintArgs="-config ../examples/src/test/resources/examples/simple/config.yaml -spec ../examples/src/test/resources/examples/simple/requestData.json -output ./output.pdf"


Run using gretty/jettyRun
-------------------------

The following command will run mapfish print using gretty/jetty. The default port is 8080, but can be changed using -PhttpPort="..." parameter.

.. code::

  > ./gradlew jettyRun -PhttpPort=8090
